
	Details in regard to animations.
- Animations run at 30fps.
- RunningAnimation.cs controls the current frame of animation.
            float newFrame = CurrentFrame + 30 * (ShouldRewind ? -dt : dt) * (Animation.EaseAnimationSpeed ? EasingFactor : 1);

			if (dt >= 0 && CurrentFrame >= Animation.QuantityFrames) // here and in the modulo used to be a -1 but that skips the last frame (tyron 10dec2020)
			{
				Iterations++;
				CurrentFrame = GameMath.Mod(newFrame, Animation.QuantityFrames);
			}
			if (dt < 0 && CurrentFrame < 0)
			{
				Iterations++;
				CurrentFrame = GameMath.Mod(newFrame, Animation.QuantityFrames);
			}

ElementPose seems to control most of the per-frame calculations.



 Working backwards from Rendering:
1. Render in EntityAnimated shader.
2. Multiply default model matrix by ElementTransforms.values[jointId];
3. ElementTransforms:
	ElementTransforms is specified as "Animation" UBO in AnimateableRenderer.cs (Line 145).
	ElementTransforms is created as animator.Matrices (return activeAnimCount > 0 ? TransformationMatrices : TransformationMatricesDefaultPose;) (AnimatorBase.cs Line 48)
	Need to find both TransformationMatrices and TransformationMatricesDefaultPose.
	4. TransformationMatrices:
		public float[] TransformationMatrices = new float[16 * GlobalConstants.MaxAnimatedElements];
		TransformationMatrices is a 1D array, where indices 0 to 15 are for jointID = 0. 16 to 31 are jointId = 1, etc etc.
		If unused, initialized as identity matrix. TransformationMatrices[jointid * 16 + j] = identMat[j];
		
Joint ID




oh my 
Every frame - The animations get calculated at runtime.
Each 'joint' has an ID and an associated matrix that gets passed into the EntityAnimated shader.
This matrix is then multiplied by the standard model matrix of the element.

Questions... 
Where is Joint ID assigned?
How, techincally, are the matrices calculated?
How is the Animation property actually used in runtime?	


Should be able to use the update frame to upload a matrix for it, but this may be inefficient.
Will have to take a look.
Update updates every frame so exceptionally useful for what I need.


Next thing is figuring out how joints work...

 
 - Create Joints
 - Create Animation Data
